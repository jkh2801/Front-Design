                <p>The division of Europe into a number of independent states,
                    connected, however, with each other, by the general resemblance of
                    religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most
                    beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern tyrant,
                    who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his
                    people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example of
                    his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies,
                    and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure,
                    escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would easily
                    obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune
                    adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaints, and perhaps the
                    means of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the world, and
                    when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world
                    became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. The slave of
                    Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded
                    chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life or exile on the
                    barren rock of Seriphus, or the frozen banks of the Danube, expected
                    his fate in silent despair. To resist was fatal, and it was
                    impossible to fly. On every side he was encompassed with a vast
                    extent of sea and land, which he could never hope to traverse
                    without being discovered, seized, and restored to his irritated
                    master. Beyond the frontiers, his anxious view could discover
                    nothing, except the ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of
                    barbarians, of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent
                    kings, who would gladly purchase the emperor's protection by the
                    sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitive. “Wherever you are,” said Cicero
