        <p>The division of Europe into a number of independent states,
            connected, however, with each other, by the general resemblance of
            religion, language, and manners, is productive of the most
            beneficial consequences to the liberty of mankind. A modern tyrant,
            who should find no resistance either in his own breast, or in his
            people, would soon experience a gentle restraint from the example of
            his equals, the dread of present censure, the advice of his allies,
            and the apprehension of his enemies. The object of his displeasure,
            escaping from the narrow limits of his dominions, would easily
            obtain, in a happier climate, a secure refuge, a new fortune
            adequate to his merit, the freedom of complaints, and perhaps the
            means of revenge. But the empire of the Romans filled the world, and
            when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world
            became a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. The slave of
            Imperial despotism, whether he was condemned to drag his gilded
            chain in Rome and the senate, or to wear out a life or exile on the
            barren rock of Seriphus, or the frozen banks of the Danube, expected
            his fate in silent despair. To resist was fatal, and it was
            impossible to fly. On every side he was encompassed with a vast
            extent of sea and land, which he could never hope to traverse
            without being discovered, seized, and restored to his irritated
            master. Beyond the frontiers, his anxious view could discover
            nothing, except the ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of
            barbarians, of fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent
            kings, who would gladly purchase the emperor's protection by the
            sacrifice of an obnoxious fugitive. “Wherever you are,” said Cicero
            to the exiled Marcellus, “remember that you are equally within the
            power of the conqueror.”</p>
